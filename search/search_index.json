The image below shows one FastQC-generated plot that indicatesa very high quality sample:</p> <p></p> <p>The x-axis displays the base position in the read, and the y-axis shows quality scores. In this  example, the sample contains reads that are 40 bp long. This is much shorter than the reads we  are working with in our workflow. For each position, there is a box-and-whisker plot showing  the distribution of quality scores for all reads at that position. The horizontal red line  indicates the median quality score and the yellow box shows the 1st to  3rd quartile range. This means that 50% of reads have a quality score that falls within the  range of the yellow box at that position. The whiskers show the absolute range, which covers  the lowest (0th quartile) to highest (4th quartile) values.</p> <p>For each position in this sample, the quality values do not drop much lower than 32. This  is a high quality score.

This plot displays patterns in base quality along these tiles. Consistently low scores are often found around the edges, but hot spots can also occur in the middle if an air bubble was introduced at some point during the run. </li> <li>Per sequence quality scores: a density plot of quality for all reads at all positions. This plot shows what quality scores are most common. </li> <li>Per base sequence content: plots the proportion of each base position over all of the reads. Typically, we expect to see each base roughly 25% of the time at each position, but this often fails at the beginning or end of the read due to quality or adapter content.</li> <li>Per sequence GC content: a density plot of average GC content in each of the reads.  </li> <li>Per base N content: the percent of times that 'N' occurs at a position in all reads. If there is an increase at a particular position, this might indicate that something went wrong during sequencing.  </li> <li>Sequence Length Distribution: the distribution of sequence lengths of all reads in the file. If the data is raw, there is often on sharp peak, however if the reads have been trimmed, there may be a distribution of shorter lengths. </li> <li>Sequence Duplication Levels: A distribution of duplicated sequences. In sequencing, we expect most reads to only occur once. If some sequences are occurring more than once, it might indicate enrichment bias (e.g. from PCR). If the samples are high coverage (or RNA-seq or amplicon), this might not be true.  </li> <li>Overrepresented sequences: A list of sequences that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance. </li> <li>Adapter Content: a graph indicating where adapater sequences occur in the reads.</li> <li>K-mer Content: a graph showing any sequences which may show a positional bias within the reads.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"05_starting_with_data/#extra-info","title":"Extra Info","text":"<p>if you ever need to download &gt;10 accessions from the SRA, the <code>sra-toolkit</code> is a great tool to do this with!

They are ubiquitous within a certain chemistry, and so are present across all sequenced samples.  Barcodes are unique nucleotide sequences used to identify a specific sample when multiple samples are sequenced in a single lane. After barcoded samples are separated from one another in a process called demultiplexing, barcodes are no longer needed in a sequence.  It is generally a good idea to remove adapters and barcodes from sequencing samples before proceeding with any downstream application.  However, if you are using a pipeline that involves matching between reads and a quality reference, you may get similar results with or without adapter trimming. For quick estimation </li> <li>Quality trimming: Quality trimming removes low-quality bases from sequences reads. The user can set the stringency cut off for \"low quality\" by indicating a phred score at which to trim. </li> <li>K-mer trimming: K-mer trimming removes k-mers that occur very few times in a sequencing dataset. In reads with sufficient sequencing depth, we expect real k-mers to occur multiple times. When a single sequencing error occurs in a read, this produces k erroneous k-mers. K-mer trimming trims a read to remove all of these k-mers. K-mer trimming does not rely on information from the sequencer like phred scores, but instead on the biological signal in the reads themselves.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"06_quality_control/#when-and-how-to-trim","title":"When and how to trim?","text":"<p>Trimming is a balance of removing artificial or incorrect nucleotides and retaining true nucleotides in sequencing data.  What and when to trim therefore changes with the sequencing application, and with the sequencing data itself.  Below we explore some trimming use cases to help develop an intuition for what type of trimming is necessary and when.</p> <ul> <li>Single-species genomic sequencing for assembly:  Let's imagine we have just sequenced an Escherichia coli isolate with 100X coverage and would like to assemble the isolate.  We would first want to remove adapters and barcodes to prevent these sequences from ending up in our final assembly.  Then, stringent quality and k-mer trimming may be appropriate, because we have high coverage data; even if we were to stringently trim and were only left with 50% of our original number of reads, we would still have 50X coverage of very high quality data.  50X coverage is sufficient to acheive a good bacterial assembly in most cases. </li> <li>de novo RNA-sequencing assembly Now let's imagine we have sequenced the transcriptome of our favorite species which does not currently have a reference transcriptome. Because RNA transcripts have different abundance profiles, we can't use average coverage in the same way as we used it for single-species genomic sequencing.  We need to be more careful when we k-mer and error trim so as not to accidentally remove low-abundance reads that represent true transcripts. We would likely use light quality trimming (e.g. a phred score of ~5). For k-mer trimming, we would only trim reads that contain high-abundance k-mers.</li> <li>Metagenome de novo assembly Trimming metagenomic reads for de novo assembly is similar to trimming RNA-sequencing reads for de novo transcriptome assembly. Because there are often low-abundance organisms that have low-coverage in our sequencing datasets, we need to be careful not to accidently remove these during trimming. </li> <li>Metagenome read mapping  In referenced-based analyses including mapping of metagenomic reads to a set of reference genomes, reads will often map even when they contain adapters and barcodes.  However, in some cases, the presence of adapters and barcodes does prevent mapping, so it is safer to remove all barcodes and adapters. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"06_quality_control/#references-about-trimming","title":"References about trimming","text":"<p>Many scientific studies have explored the trimming parameter space in an effort to make recommendations for different applications.

Why?</p> <p>First, fastp trims based solely on the quality score, which is a statistical statement about the correctness of a base - a Q score of 30 means that, of 1000 bases with that Q score, 1 of those bases will be wrong.  So, a base can have a high Q score and still be wrong (and many bases will have a low Q score and still be correct)!</p> <p>Second, we trimmed very lightly - only bases that had a very low quality were removed.  This was intentional because we want to retain as much coverage as possible for our downstream techniques (many of which do not suffer too much if some errors remain).</p> <p>An alternative to trimming based on the quality scores is to trim based on k-mer abundance - this is known as k-mer spectral error trimming.  K-mer spectral error trimming always beats quality score trimming in terms of eliminating errors; e.g. look at this table from Zhang et al., 2014:</p> <p></p> <p>The basic logic is this: if you see low abundance k-mers in a high coverage data set, those k-mers are almost certainly the result of errors.

We saw this in the previous lesson, where we were only able to classify ~10% of the reads in our sample.</p> <pre><code>== This is sourmash version 3.0.1. ==\n== Please cite Brown and Irber (2016), doi:10.21105/joss.00027. ==\n\nloaded 1 LCA databases. ksize=31, scaled=10000\nselecting specified query k=31\nloaded query: SRR1976948...

K-mers of size 31 are fairly specific. Even if a sequence had 30 basepairs exactly in common with another sequence, if the 31st is different, it would not count as a match. Aligning reads to close relatives is a more lenient approach, and could lead to 5-10% more reads being classified. This is pretty good, but there are ways to do better.</p> <p>2) de novo assemble and bin the reads into metagenome assembled genomes. de novo assembly and binning are reference-free approaches to produce metagenome-assembled genomes (bins) from metagenome reads. de novo assembly works by finding overlaps between reads and assembling them into larger \"contiguous sequences\" (usually shortened to contigs). Depending on the depth, coverage, and biological properties of a sample, these contigs range in size from 500 base pairs to hundreds of thousands of base pairs. These assemblies can then be binned into metagenome-assembled genomes. Most binners use tetranucleotide frequency and abundance information to bin contigs. A tetranucleotide is a 4 base pair sequence within a genome. Almost all tetranucleotides occur in almost all genomes, however the frequency that they occur in a given genome is usually conserved (see here). So, binners exploit this information and calculate tetranucleotide frequency for all contigs in an assembly, and group the contigs together that have similar frequencies. This is also coupled with abundance information; if two contigs belong together, they probably have the same abundance because they came from the same organism in a sample. These approaches allow researchers to ask questions about the genomes of organisms in metagenomes even if there is no reference that has been sequenced before. For this reason, they are both very popular and very powerful. However, both assembly and binning suffer from biases that lead to incomplete results. Assembly fails when either 1) an area does not have enough reads to cover the region (low coverage) and 2) when the region is too complicated and there are too many viable combinations of sequences so the assembler doesn't know how to make a decision. This second scenario can occur when there are a lot of errors in the reads, or when there is a lot of strain variation in a genome.  In either case, the assembly breaks and outputs fragmented contigs, or no contigs at all. Although tetranucleotide frequency and abundance information are strong signals, tetranucleotide frequency can only be reliably estimated on contigs that are &gt;2000 base pairs. Because many things fail to assemble to that length, they are not binned.  To give an idea of how much is missed by de novo assembly and binning, consider our sourmash results. The sample that we are analyzing was originally analyzed with a de novo assembly and binning pipeline. The high-quality bins were then uploaded to GenBank and are now part of the database.  Look at the sourmash output (above).  Any genome match that ends in two numbers separated by an underscore (e.g. 46_43) is a de novo metagenome-assembled genome produced by the original analysis. Even with the exact genomes in our sample in the database, we were only able to classify 10% of the k-mers in our sample. This leaves a lot of data on the table.</p> <p>3) Continue the analysis with gene-level techniques. Often times, many more contigs will assemble than will bin.  In cases like this, it's possible to do a gene-level analysis of a metagenome where you annotate open reading frames (ORFs) on the assembled contigs. This type of analysis can give you an idea of the functional potential in our metagenome.</p> <p>4) Continue the analysis with read-based techniques. If something has no known reference and doesn't assemble or bin, what can you do?  There are many tools that work directly on metagenome reads to estimate taxonomy or function (e.g. gene identity). These tools include Kraken and mifaser.  We've had varying degrees of success with this type of approach, depending on the sample being analyzed.</p> <p>5) Exploit connectivity of DNA sequences to assign more reads to the pangenome of sourmash matches. We can do this with a tool called spacegraphcats. The rest of this lesson covers background knowledge for this approach and why it works, and gives a step-by-step guide of how to do it.</p>"},{"location":"08_bin_completion_with_spacegraphcats/#representing-all-the-k-mers-de-bruijn-graphs-and-compact-de-bruijn-graphs","title":"Representing all the k-mers: de Bruijn graphs and compact de Bruijn graphs","text":"<p>In real life, DNA sequences are fully contiguous within a genome (or chromosome).  When we chop a genome up into little pieces to sequence it, we lose this connectivity information. In order to get this connectivity information back to create an assembly, we must find every possible set of overlaps between all reads. This information is often represented in a de Bruijn graph. A de Bruijn graph is built by chopping sequencing data into k-mers and finding all overlaps of size k-1 between all k-mers. The graph below demonstrates this process. Each node in the graph represents a k-mer (here of size 4), and each arrows represents that two k-mers overlap by k-1 nucleotides (here, by 3 nucleotides).  Each k-mer only occurs in the graph once.</p> <p></p> <p>A compact de Bruijn graph (cDBG) is built from the de Bruijn graph by collapsing all linear paths of k-mers into a single node.

What's more, with a large enough k-mer size (e.g. 31), k-mers from the same genome tend to be connected within the graph because they are connected within the real genome.  spacegraphcats takes advantage of this information to reassociate k-mers that belong together but were not recovered by assembly.</p>"},{"location":"08_bin_completion_with_spacegraphcats/#sequence-context-in-a-cdbg","title":"Sequence context in a cDBG","text":"<p>As outlined above, many reads do not match known references, don't assemble, and/or don't bin.  What if this occurs in a region that you particularly care about? How can we use the fact that all k-mers in a metagenome are contained within a cDBG to get more information about our region of interest?</p> <p>Look at the figure below.  The first part of the abstract of this study states:</p> <pre><code>Dissimilatory perchlorate reduction is an anaerobic respiratory pathway that in communities might \nbe influenced by metabolic interactions. Because the genes for perchlorate reduction are horizontally \ntransferred, previous studies have been unable to identify uncultivated perchlorate-reducing \npopulations. Here we recovered metagenome-assembled genomes from perchlorate-reducing sediment \nenrichments and employed a manual scaffolding approach to reconstruct gene clusters for perchlorate \nreduction found within mobile genetic elements. \n</code></pre> <p>Essentially, the authors of this study knew that dissimilatory perchlorate reduction was important in their microbial communities of interest. But because perchlorate reduction genes are horizontally transferred, they're hard to identify in metagenomic sequencing data. This is likely because strain variation (e.g. small differences in the same genes in different organisms in a community) around these genes broke assembly. However, given their importance, the authors of this study knew that they should be present in the metagenome. Therefore, they dug into the cDBG that contained all metagenome reads, and were able to see the sequence context of their genes of interest.  We see that because these genes are horizontally transferred, sometimes the sequence flanking their genes of interest comes from multiple species.  However, even in this case, regions of the sub-cDBG segregate to each species that contains the gene of interest. In other cases (e.g. at 7% salinity), only one organism flanks pcrA.  Yet we see from bubbles and offshoots in the graph that even when pcrA is contained only within one species, there is still variation that likely confounded assembly and binning. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"08_bin_completion_with_spacegraphcats/#scaling-it-up","title":"Scaling it up","text":"<p>The study we were looking at above looked for genes involved in dissimilatory perchlorate reduction using manual curation --  e.g. they built a cDBG for each sample, visualized it with a tool called Bandage, then used BLAST to find their genes of interest. This approach is great, but incredibly time consuming and difficult to automate.  What's more, this approach does not scale.  Given the complexity of cDBGs, each \"query\" (e.g. look up within the graph) takes a lot of computational resources. As such, although this approach is tractable for a few genes (and shows really cool results at that scale!), it wouldn't work for every gene that is assembled in a metagenome.  But imagine if it could! Using de novo approaches, most bins are not 100% complete.  What if we could use a whole bin as a query, and pull out its context within a cDBG? We could \"complete\" a bin by pulling all the things that didn't assemble or bin, but that through close location in the cDBG, we know belongs with the bin.</p> <p>Enter spacegraphcats.  Spacegraphcats uses a novel data structure to represent the cDBG with less complexity while maintaining biological relationships between the sequences.  It then uses novel algorithms that exploit properties of the cDBG to quickly query into the data structure.</p> <p>To visualize this, let's look at a cDBG of an Escherichia coli genome + errors  (this is an isolate, so we're using the errors to simulate strain variation in a real metagenome community.  It's a rough approximation that works well for visualizing what spacegraphcats does under the hood).  On the left is the cDBG, and on the right is the simplified structure produced by spacegraphcats. The structure on the right is much easier to query into.</p> <p></p> <p>Spacegraphcats queries work by decomposing the query into k-mers, finding the node in which a query k-mer is contained within the spacegraphcats graph, and returning all of the k-mers in that node.

What do these amino acid sequences encode?  Are they strain variants (e.g. a few amino acids different) from those that were already in the query, or do they add new functionality? In this lesson, we will annotate the amino acid sequences in our PLASS assembly and in the GenBank assembly, and then compare the encoded functions.</p> <p>As with most things in bioinformatics, there are many ways to annotate amino acid sequences.  We will be using <code>kofamscan</code>, a tool that uses hidden markov models built from KEGG orthologs to assign KEGG ortholog numbers to new amino acid sequences. Hidden markov models work well for protein annotation because they weight the importance of each amino acid in determining the final assignment. Look at the figure below.</p> <p></p> <p>This figure is a logo depicting the PFAM HMM for rpsG.  rpsG encodes 30S ribosomal protein S7, and it is a highly conserved protein.  The HMM was built from hundreds of rpsG protein sequences.  At each position of the protein, the logo depicts the liklihood of seeing a specific amino acid. The larger the amino acid is in the logo, the more likely it is to be observed at that position.  In positions where no amino acid is visible, it is less important which amino acid occurs there. This encoding is more flexible than something like Hamming distance or BLAST because it incorporates biological importance of amino acid positionality. This approach works well on novel amino acid sequences that are not closely related to anything currently housed in databases.</p> <p>kofamscan is a tool released by the KEGG that includes HMMs built from each KEGG ortholog.  Using kofamscan, we can assign KEGG orthologs to our amino acid sequences.  This allows us to take advantage of KEGG pathway information to determine if any pathways are more complete in our neighborhood than in our query.</p>"},{"location":"10_annotating_amino_acid_sequences/#running-kofamscan","title":"Running kofamscan","text":"<p>First, start an <code>srun</code> session.</p> <pre><code>srun -p bmh -J KO -t 48:00:00 --mem=8gb -c 6 --pty bash\n</code></pre> <p>kofamscan is not available as a conda package, but being able to use the KEGG framework is important enough to deal with installing the kofamscan package manually.</p> <p>We'll create a new environment for kofamscan, and use conda to install all of its dependencies.</p> <pre><code>mamba create -n kofamscan hmmer parallel ruby kofamscan\nconda activate kofamscan\n</code></pre> <p>Now, check that the installation worked properly by running kofamscan with the <code>--help</code> option:</p> <pre><code>exec_annotation --help\n</code></pre> <p><code>exec_annotation</code> is the name of the script that runs <code>kofamscan</code></p> <pre><code>cd ~/2020_rotation_project\nmkdir -p kofamscan\ncd kofamscan\nln -s ../plass/query_nbhd_plass.cdhit.fa ./\nln -s ../blast/GCA_001508995.1_ASM150899v1_protein.faa ./\n</code></pre> <p>Then, download the databases and executables for the kofamscan program.</p> <pre><code>wget ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/db/kofam/ko_list.gz                  # download the ko list \nwget ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/db/kofam/profiles.tar.gz           # download the hmm profiles\n</code></pre> <p>Unzip and untar the relevant files:</p> <pre><code>gunzip ko_list.gz\ntar xf profiles.tar.gz\n</code></pre> <p>kofamscan runs using a config file.
